# EliteHell
Once Elite_Virus.apk is installed, it starts sending random sms to all the contacts from Phone book unless the limit goes to 0.
It blocks the messenger, formats the SDCard and restarts upon phone reboot.

# How to remove the virus ?
```
You wont be able to remove the virus simply by going in the app manager, You can use the anti-virus
"HellBoy" and remove it completely.
```
